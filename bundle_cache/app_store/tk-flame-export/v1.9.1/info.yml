    plate_presets:
        type: list
        description: "A list of dictionaries in which you define the various export presets to
                     appear on the profiles dropdown in the user interface. These presets are matched up
                     with export profiles defined inside the settings hook. The list of presets in this setting
                     basically defines the various profiles and their locations on disk, and the hook contains
                     all the details defining how the export should be written out to disk (resolution, bit
                     depth, file format etc). The structure of this setting is a list of dictionaries. Each
                     dictionary item contains three keys: `name`, `publish_type` and `template`. The `name`
                     parameter is the identifier for the preset - this name will appear in the dropdown in the UI.
                     It is also used to identify the preset inside the settings hook. The `publish_type` parameter
                     defines the publish type that should be associated with any exported plates when they reach
                     Shotgun. Lastly, the `template` parameter defines where on disk the image sequence should be
                     written out."

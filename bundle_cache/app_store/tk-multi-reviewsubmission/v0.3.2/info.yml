configuration:
    upload_to_shotgun:
        type: bool
        default_value: true
        description: Should the movie being created be uploaded to Shotgun
                     as a version or just kept on disk? Disabling this as well
                     as the store_on_disk option effectively disables the whole
                     tool.

    store_on_disk:
        type: bool
        default_value: true
        description: Should the movie being created be kept on disk? Disabling
                     this as well as the upload_to_shotgun option will
                     effectively disable the whole tool.

    movie_path_template:
        type: template
        required_fields: []
        optional_fields: "*"
        description: Template defining the output location of the movie file
                     on the the file system. For this template you can use all
                     the fields defined in the template passed to the
                     render_and_submit fields. In addition to these you can use
                     the special fields width and height, which contain the
                     resolution of the movie. If the store_on_disk setting is
                     false, this setting will still be required but will be used
                     as a temporary location for processing before the file is
                     uploaded to Shotgun.

    movie_width:
        type: int
        default_value: 1024
        description: The width of the rendered movie file

    movie_height:
        type: int
        default_value: 540
        description: The height of the rendered movie file

    new_version_status:
        type: str
        default_value: rev
        description: The value to use for a new Version's status.

    version_number_padding:
        type: int
        default_value: 3
        description: This value will be used to pad the version number in the
                     slate and various movie burnins. This will not affect version
                     number padding in the movie filename. See movie_path_template.
                     Use 1 for no padding.

    slate_logo:
        type: config_path
        description: This is the path to an image to use on the slate such as a
                     company logo. The supplied image will be reformated into a 
                     400 pixel box and the lower left corner of the logo will be
                     aligned 100 pixels to the right and 100 pixels above the
                     lower left corner of the slate. You can use an image with
                     an alpha channel if you want to add transparency. Currently
                     any image format supported by Nuke is adequate. If this
                     setting is an empty string, no logo will be applied.
        default_value: ""

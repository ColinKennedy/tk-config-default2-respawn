configuration:

    default_node_name:
        type: str
        description: >
            A default name for Alembic output nodes created in houdini.
            Allowed characters include letters, numbers, periods, dashes, or
            underscores.
        default_value: sgtk_alembic

    work_file_template:
        type: template
        description: >
            A reference to a template which locates a Houdini work file on
            disk.  This is used to drive the version and optionally the name of
            output files.
        fields: context, version, [name]

    output_profiles:
        type: list
        allows_empty: False
        description: >
            A list of dictionaries defining the various alembic output
            profiles. Each profile contains a unique name that describes the
            profile, the cach template for writing to disk, a color to
            distinguish each profile type in the node graph, and optional
            settings to apply to the internal Alembic node.
            
        values: 
            type: dict
            description: > 
                An output profile dictionary that defines how the Tk Alembic
                node should look in houdini and where it should write its
                cache.
            items:
                name:
                    type: str
                    description: >
                        A human readable name describing this output profile.

                settings:
                    type: dict
                    description: >
                        A dictionary of settings to apply to the internal
                        Alembic node when this profile is selected.

                color:
                    type: list     
                    description: >
                        Specify a list of 3 values in the range 0.0-1.0 that
                        represent the RGB values to be set for the node
                        background/tile_color in the node graph when this
                        profile is used. Specify an empty list to use the
                        default colour.
                    values:
                        type: float
                    allows_empty: True
                    default_value: []

                output_cache_template:
                    type: template
                    description: >
                        A reference to a template which defines where the
                        alembic cache will be written to disk.

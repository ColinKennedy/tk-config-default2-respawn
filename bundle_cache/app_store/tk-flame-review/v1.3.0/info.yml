configuration:

    menu_name:
        type: str
        description: One line description of this profile. This will appear on the menu in Flame.
        default_value: "Submit for Shotgun review"
                     
    shotgun_entity_type:
        type: str
        description: The entity type in Shotgun to associate a Flame export with.
        default_value: "Sequence"
    
    task_template:
        type: str
        description: The Shotgun task template to assign to new shotgun entities or blank if none.
        default_value: ""

    bypass_shotgun_transcoding:
        description: Try to bypass the Shotgun server side transcoding if possible. This will only generate
                     and upload a h264 quicktime and not a webm, meaning that playback will not be
                     supported on firefox and no filmstrip thumbnails will be generated. The benefit of
                     bypassing the transcoding is that the sequence is reviewable immediately after upload
                     and the quality is significantly better.
        type: bool
        default_value: False

                     a job sent to Backburner or directly in foreground during the
                     submission process.

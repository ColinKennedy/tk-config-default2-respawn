display_name: "Custom Field Widget"

description:
    Toolkit provides a set of standard widgets to display and edit Shotgun
    fields within a Qt application. This demo shows how to override one of those
    default widgets with a custom widget. Custom widgets can be used for
    displaying values, editing values, or both.

display_name: "Shotgun Hierarchy"

description:
    The SimpleShotgunHierarchyModel in combination with the
    ShotgunHierarchyView displays an entity hierarchy as defined in the
    Tracking Settings in Shotgun. The model works by providing a url to the
    root level of the hierarchy you're interested in (ex. /Project/65), a
    'seed' entity field which represents where the hierarchy should lead to
    (ex. PublishedFile.entity, and an optional dictionary that defines the
    fields that should be returned for the various entity types in the
    hierarchy. The model is lazy loaded as items are expanded.

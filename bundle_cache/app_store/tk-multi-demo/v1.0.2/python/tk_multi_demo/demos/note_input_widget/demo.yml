description:
    The note editor widget makes it easy to attach Notes to SG entities. You can
    use the widget either to create or reply to notes. The editor includes
    screen grabbing capabilities and a user name auto completer. If you start
    typing @xyz, an auto completer will kick in and show matching groups and
    users. Once added to the note text, these users will automatically be
    included in the TO list in the case of a new note and in the CC list in the
    case of a reply.

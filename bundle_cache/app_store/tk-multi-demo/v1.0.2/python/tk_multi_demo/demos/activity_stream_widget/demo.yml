description:
    The activity stream widget is a QT widget that renders the activity stream
    for a given Shotgun entity. The functionality is similar to that in the
    activity stream found inside the Shotgun web application. Publishes and
    Versions show up with thumbnails, optionally with playback links. Notes
    show up with replies and attachments and you can reply to notes directly
    in the activity stream.

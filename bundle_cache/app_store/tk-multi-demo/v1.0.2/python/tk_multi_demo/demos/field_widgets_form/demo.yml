display_name: "Shotgun Field Widgets Form"

description:
  The shotgun_fields module provides access to Qt widgets that correspond to the
  field types available on Shotgun entities. The purpose of these widgets is to
  make it easier to build apps that interact with Shotgun in a standardized way.
  This demo shows an exaple of how to use these widgets directly to build a
  form view for specific fields on an entity. Note that this is just a demo, and
  editing the values in the form will not be pushed back to Shotgun.

display_name: "Shotgun Field Delegate"

description:
    A delegate for a given type of Shotgun field.  This delegate is designed to
    work with indexes from a ShotgunModel where the value of the field is stored
    in the SG_ASSOCIATED_FIELD_ROLE role. To use this delegate with other types
    of models, simply use the data_role property to identify the role in the
    source model where data should be set and retrieved.

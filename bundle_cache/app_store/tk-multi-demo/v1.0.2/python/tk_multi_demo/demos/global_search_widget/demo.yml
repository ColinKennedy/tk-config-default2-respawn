display_name: "Global Search"

description:
    The global search widget is similar to the search found in Shotgun. It
    returns a number of matches based on a text that is being typed in by the
    user. Once a user selects an object, a signal fires to indicate the request.
    The breadth of the search can be limited by specifying entity types and
    filters to search against.

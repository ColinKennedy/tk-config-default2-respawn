description:
    The Shotgun Playback Label is a simple QLabel override which makes it easy
    to indicate that a thumbnail can be played back. The widget takes care of 
    analyzing provided shotgun data, and in case the Shotgun data contains 
    playable media, the playback icon will automatically appear. Clicking 
    the playback icon will launch a playback action, currently launching 
    Shotgun screening room in a web browser.

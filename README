Include Rez as part of the rez packages (so that we make sure that Rez is installed).
Figure out a way to let app_launch.py use multiple Python file(s).


Change "rez-nuke" to just "nuke". It's too confusing having to keep track of
all the package names vs. their install names

Build Steps
--- Attempt to get the package configuration
- If the context could not resolve then
 --- Load the package.py file directly in the original environment location
 - Iterate over the required packages (recursively)
  -? (maybe through the package?)
 - Build each package as-needed
